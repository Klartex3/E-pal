<p>1.	Don’t cram!
It might be tempting to leave all you’re studying for that big exam up until the last minute. But research suggest that cramming does not improve longer term learning 
Students may perform well on a test
For which they’ve crammed. But that doesn’t mean they’ve truly learn the material. Instead of cramming, studies have shown that studying with the goal of long-term retention is the best for learning overall.

<header><b><h1>2. Ask for Help</b1></h1></header>
<p>You don’t have to struggle during difficult material on your own. Many students are not used to seeking help while in high school. There are multiple resources to help you including your mentors, tutor and fellow classmates
<header><b><h1></b>3. Set Specific Goals</h1></header>
<p>Setting specific goals along the way of your studying journey can show how much progress you’ve made. It’s better to use the SMART method:
<ol>
<li>Specific: Set Specific goals with an actionable plan, such as ‘I will study everyday between 7 to 8 pm’.</li>
<li>Measurable: Plan to study a certain number of hours or raise your exam score by a certain percent to give you a measurable benchmark.</li>
<li>Realistic: It’s important that your goals be realistic so you don’t get discouraged .For example, if you study for 1 hour per day increase the number of hours to 3 hours rather than 5 hours.</li>
<li>Time-Specific: Keep your goals consistent with your academic calendar and your other responsibilities.</li>
</ol>
Using a handful of these study tips can ensure that you’re getting the most out the material in your classes and help set up for success for the rest of your academic career and beyond.
